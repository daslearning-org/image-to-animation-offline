# üì∑ ‚ûú ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Offline Image to Animation Maker
An open-source, cross-platform, offline app for Android, Linux, Windows, Mac & iOS (Mac & iOS apps are not built by us, but can be done using the documentation). Just upload an image & generate a sketch style animation video file in seconds or munites (depends on device) without an Internet connection.

> Overview: The app uses KivyMD and Kivy mainly for the UI. The app uses `Numpy` & `OpenCV` as the logic backbone which generates the video from an image.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Quickstart Guide

### üì± Download & Run the Android App
You can check the [Releases](https://github.com/daslearning-org/image-to-animation-offline/tags) and downlaod the latest version of the android app on your phone.

> If you use the `Download` button from the app, you can save the animation video in one of the mentioned folders: `Downloads`, `Movies`, `Videos` due android file access restrictions on `Android 11+`.

### üíª Download & Run the Windows or Linux App
You can check the [Releases](https://github.com/daslearning-org/image-to-animation-offline/tags) and downlaod the latest version of the app on your `Linux` or `Windows` platform. The Linux app has no extension, you may need to change the permission of the file to run it. The Windows app will have an `exe` extension, just double click & run it (You may need to create an exception for Antivirus if there is any detection).

### üêç Run with Python

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daslearning-org/image-to-animation-offline.git
```

2. Run the application
```bash
cd image-to-animation-offline/kivy/
pip install -r requirements.txt # virtual environment is recommended
python main.py
```

## ü¶æ Build your own App
The Kivy project has a great tool named [Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can make mobile apps for `Android` & `iOS`

### üì± Build Android App
A Linux environment is recommended for the app development. If you are on Windows, you may use `WSL` or any `Virtual Machine`. As of now the `buildozer` tool works on Python version `3.11` at maximum. I am going to use Python `3.11`

```bash
# add the python repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update

# install all dependencies.
sudo apt install -y ant autoconf automake ccache cmake g++ gcc lbzip2 libffi-dev libltdl-dev libtool libssl-dev make openjdk-17-jdk patch pkg-config python3-dev python3-pip unzip wget zip git python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev

# optionally you may check the java installation with below commands
java -version
javac -version

# install python modules
git clone https://github.com/daslearning-org/image-to-animation-offline.git
cd image-to-animation-offline/kivy/
python3.11 -m venv .env # create python virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r req_android.txt

# build the android apk
buildozer android debug # this may take a good amount of time for the first time & will generate the apk in the bin directory

## build AAB for playstore
# generate a key
export APP_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
export APP_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_key.jks -alias your_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -storepass $APP_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -keypass $APP_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD -dname "CN=SomnathDas, OU=IT, O=DasLearning, L=Kolkata, ST=WB, C=IN" # this is one time activity for the app

# set the below in buildozer.spec
android.sign = True
android.keystore = /path/to/your_key.jks
android.key.alias = your_alias
android.release_artifact = aab

# then build the aab
buildozer -v android release
```

### üñ≥ Build Computer Application (Windows / Linux / MacOS)
A `Python` virtual environment is recommended and please follow the same steps from above till the pip module installations (do not require buildozer for desktop apps). It builds a native app depending on the OS type i.e. `.exe` if you are running `PyInstaller` from a Windows machine. Build computer apps from [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrx/pyinstaller-windows) for any OS type.

```bash
# install pyinstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# generate the spec file <<OPTIONAL>>
pyinstaller --name "dlDesktop" --windowed --onefile main.py # optional as it is already created in the repo

# then update the spec file as needed
# then build your app which will be native to the OS i.e. Linux or Windows or MAC
pyinstaller dlDesktop.spec
```

#### Build Windows exe from Linux

* Install Wine
```bash
# Add the Wine repository key
sudo mkdir -pm755 /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/winehq-archive.key https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key

# Add the Wine repository for your Linux Mint version
# For Linux Mint 21.x (Vanessa, Virginia, Victoria - based on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish)
# Replace 'jammy' with your Ubuntu base codename if different (e.g., 'focal' for Mint 20.x)
sudo wget -NP /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/jammy/winehq-jammy.sources

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install Wine (Stable branch is usually recommended)
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable

# If you need 32-bit support (highly recommended for Python/PyInstaller compatibility)
# This command typically handles it, but if you encounter issues later, ensure 32-bit architecture is enabled:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wine32 # This might be pulled by winehq-stable, but good to ensure
```

* Download Windows Python from [official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and then install
```bash
# Navigate to where you downloaded the Python installer
cd ~/Downloads

# Run the installer using wine
# Replace 'python-3.9.13-amd64.exe' with the actual filename you downloaded
wine python-3.9.13-amd64.exe
```

* Then run the development
```bash
cd kivy/
wine pip install pyinstaller
wine pip install -r requirements.txt
# Also install kivy-deps.sdl2, kivy-deps.glew, kivy-deps.angle explicitly if not pulled by Kivy/KivyMD
wine pip install kivy-deps.sdl2 kivy-deps.glew kivy-deps.angle

# Replace 'Python39' with your installed Python version in Wine
wine pyinstaller dlDesktop.spec # exe will be in the dist folder
```

## üêû Issues
There can be few issues & some solutions around it.

### Android Issues

* Sometimes the apk might not get installed. You may enable `Developer Options` > `USB Debugging` and run below command with [adb tool](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb).
```bash
# check your packages (it may not show the uninstalled version, some leftover may cause the issue)
adb shell pm list packages | grep imgskch

# uninstall cleans it
adb uninstall in.daslearning.imgskch

# you may use buildozer deploy run to check the adb
buildozer android debug deploy run
```
